# SPC_TUL_Course

This project is a full-stack application built with NestJS for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. It demonstrates a well-structured codebase with a focus on modularity, clean code, and best practices.

## Backend
The backend is built with NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeORM for database operations and JWT for authentication.

### Key features of the backend include:
- User authentication with JWT
- CRUD operations for users
- Integration with Azure Blob Storage

The backend code is located in the `backend` directory.

## Frontend
The frontend is built with Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It uses Vue Router for routing and Vuex for state management.

### Key features of the frontend include:
- User registration and login
- User profile management
- File upload and download with Azure Blob Storage

The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory.

## Getting Started
To run the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
